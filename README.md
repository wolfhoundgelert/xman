# xMan

`xMan` (E**x**periment **Man**ager) is a `Python` library for effective managing and organizing experiments in `Jupyter Notebooks` on th–µ `Google Colab` platform or local machines, or right in the Python `REPL` (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interactive mode.

It offers the following key features:
- ‚≠ê Keeping track of your experiments, providing a clear overview of your progress.
- ‚≠ê Saving results in a centralized location, such as a shared Google Drive folder, with the option to use intermediate checkpoints.
- ‚≠ê Running experiments in parallel across multiple Google Colab accounts, making it a powerful tool for AI, ML, NN, and DL students, learners, enthusiasts, researchers and their teams. üòç

The `xMan` library can be downloaded from the `GitHub` [repository](https://github.com/wolfhoundgelert/xman):

```commandline
!pip install git+https://github.com/wolfhoundgelert/xman.git
```
‚ùó Currently, it is not available on `PyPI` - please help me to get the `xman` repository name by leaving a comment with a [polite request to the administration of PyPI](https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/2738)

## Usage
<details><summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

Let's assume that we work in Google Colab and want our experiments to be saved in Google Drive folder, which we can share lately among other Google Colab (and related Google Drive) accounts - it will be useful if we work in a team or/and want to execute experiments in parallel under different Google Colab accounts.

We need to mount our Google Drive:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Import xman library:
```python
from xman import xman
```

We can check our Google Drive directory:
```python
xman.dir_tree('./drive/MyDrive')
```

Create a folder for our experiments specifying the path, name and description:
```python
xman.make_proj('./drive/MyDrive/xman_exps', "My Proj Name", "My proj descr")
```

Or we can load already existed project:
```python
xman.load_proj('./drive/MyDrive/xman_exps')
```

Experiment is something we can "run" in a code (or in our life) with specified parameters. When we change parameters, we make a new experiment. Similar experiments combine into a group, that is defined by some aspect we examine with our experiments with different parameters.

Thereby, we need to create a new group of experiments:
```python
xman.make_group('My Group 1', 'My group 1 descr')
# or xman.proj.make_group('My Group 1', 'My group 1 descr')
```

When we have a group, we can populate it with specific experiments (exp - single, exps - plural):
```python
xman.make_exp(1, 'My Exp 1', 'My exp 1 descr')
# or xman.make_exp('My Group 1', 'My Exp 1', 'My exp 1 descr')
# or xman.proj.group(1).make_exp('My Group 1', 'My Exp 1', 'My exp 1 descr')
```

You can view the information about your proj, groups and exps:
```python
# Detailed info:
xman.info()  # for the entire project
# or xman.group(1).info()  # for a particular group
# or xman.exp(1, 1).info()  # for a particular exp

# Output:
#     Proj [EMPTY] My Proj Name - My proj descr    
#     Resolution: -= auto status =-    
#     
#     Group 1 [EMPTY] My Group 1 - My group 1 descr    
#         Resolution: -= auto status =-    
#         
#         Exp 1 [EMPTY] My Exp 1 - My exp 1 descr    
#             Resolution: -= auto status =-

# Brief info:
xman.exp(1, 1)
# or xman.group
# or xman.proj

# Output:
#     Exp 1 [EMPTY] My Exp 1 - My exp 1 descr

# Brief info contains: struct_type struct_num [STATUS] Struct_name - Struct_descr
```

As you probably already noticed:
1. `xMan` API supports different styles:
    ```python
    # You can use chains of actions:
    xman.make_group(...).make_exp(...).set_pipeline().start().view_result()
    
    # Or work with objects:
    proj = xman.make_proj(...)  # or xman.load_proj(...) if proj already exist
    group = proj.make_group(...)  # or proj.group(num_or_name) if group already exist
    exp = group.make_exp(...)  # or group.exp(num_or_name) if exp alrady exists
    exp.start()
    exp.view_result()
    ```
2. Groups and exps can be reached by their nums and names (so, group names should be unique in the project, and exps names should be unique in a one particular group):
    ```python
    xman.group(1)  # or xman.group('My Group 1')
    xman.exp(1, 1)  # or xman.exp('My Group 1', 'My Exp 1') or combine nums and names
    ```
3. Main structures are `proj`, `group` and `exp`. Each of them contains a reach set of various API functionality. The most often usable methods are duplicated in `xman` itself, so you don't need to call `xman.proj.group(1)` or even `xman.proj.group(1).exp(1)` every time you want to get some group or exp, or other often usable API, just call:
   ```python
   xman.group(1)
   xman.exp(1, 1)
   
   # Use direct calls only for some specific methods and properties, e.g.:
   xman.proj.change_group_num(...)  # for changing group number
   xman.proj.move_exp(...)  # for moving exp in other group
   ```
   So, as you can see, you don't need to save links on your groups and experiments. You can get them whenever you want regardless of the `Google Colab` sessions and previously executed cells in your `Jupyter Notebook`, and they are reachable from `xman` itself: `xman.exp(1, 1)`.

## Sharing across Google Colab accounts
<details><summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

In `Google Drive` share your project folder with some other account. Login on `Google Drive` under that account. On the left-side panel choose `Shared with me` option, find the project shared folder, right click menu, choose `Add shortcut to Drive`. In the opened window choose `All locations` tab, click `My Drive` option, then click `Add` button below.

Now you can open `My Drive` on the left-side panel and find the project shared folder there. 

Open a new `Jupyter Notebook` or a shared copy of the original one. I recommend always make a copy of your shared notebooks when you (or your teammates) work under other `Google Colab` accounts - it will keep your notebooks from cells output conflicting during execution.

In that notebook load the project:
```python
# Mount `Google Drive`:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Install `xMan` library:
!pip install git+https://github.com/wolfhoundgelert/xman.git

# Import `xMan` library:
from xman import xman

# Load project passing its path:
xman.load_proj('./drive/MyDrive/xman_exps')

# Now you can work with your project under that other Google Colab account:
xman.info()
```

## Performing Experiments
<details><summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

A lifecycle of any experiment, either it is `ML` experiment written in code or it is some live experiment performing on a physics lesson, can be described by statuses from the next workflow:

`EMPTY` -> `TO_DO` -> `IN_PROGRESS` -> `DONE` or `ERROR` -> `SUCCESS` or `FAIL`

And it doesn't matter, we are performing our experiment manually and only writing down its results (and manually changing exp statuses for keeping track of our progress), or we are using some executable pipeline, which changes statuses automatically according to its state.

`EMPTY` - we just created a new exp record in our project and here we have only our exp name and description.

`TO_DO` - we prepared our exp for the execution (gathered the all we need together and ready to start the exp).

`IN_PROGRESS` - the exp was started, and now it is in progress.

`DONE` or `ERROR` - our exp was finished smooth, or we encountered some issues which didn't allow us to get a result.

`SUCCESS` or `FAIL` - we reviewed that we have after the previous step and decided the exp was successful (output was significant good, and we can use that further) or we failed (nothing significant, or we had even worse results than before).

As was mentioned before, `xMan` provides 2 approaches for managing experiments: manually and with setting executable pipeline.

### Manual Experiments
<details><summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

`exp` (also `group` and `proj`) is assumed to be manual if its status was set manually:
```python
xman.exp(1, 1).is_manual  # False
xman.exp(1, 1).set_manual_status('TO_DO', 'Ready for start')
xman.exp(1, 1).is_manual  # True

xman.exp(1, 1).info()
# Output:
#    Exp 1 [TO_DO *] My Exp 1 - My exp 1 descr    
#        Resolution: Ready for start
```
Pay attention on the `*` in the status `[TO_DO *]`, it says that the `exp` has a manual status and considered as a manual exp.

If some `exp` has a manual status, it can't be fed with an executable pipeline until the manual status is deleted. Use `xman.exp(...).delete_manual_status()` for deleting the manual status and making `exp` not manual again.

You can set a result manually and/or complete the exp:
```python
xman.exp(1, 1).set_manual_result('Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42')
xman.exp(1, 1).success('The answer is good enough')  # or xman.exp(1, 1).fail('Too bad')
# shortening for xman.exp(1, 1).set_manual_status('SUCCESS', 'The answer is good enough')

xman.exp(1, 1).info()
# Output:
#     Exp 1 [SUCCESS *] My Exp 1 - My exp 1 descr    
#        Resolution: The answer is good enough    
#        Result:
#            Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42
```

You can use manual exps such way:
```python
# Define the pipeline:
def train_pipeline(params...):
    # init model and environment
    # train model
    # validate and calculate score
    return result

# Define params and execute the pipeline:
params = ...
result = train_pipeline(params)

# Set the result manually:
xman.make_exp(...).set_manual_result(result)

# Review result...
xman.exp(...).info()

# ...and decide it is success or fail:
xman.exp(...).success(...)
```

### Pipeline Experiments

#### Pipelines without checkpoints
<details><summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

```python
# Define a pipeline without checkpoints:
def train_pipeline(param1, param2):
    # init model and environment
    # train model (takes some time)
    # validate and calculate score
    return f"Score 1: {param1 * 2}, Score 2: {param2 ** 2}"

# Make a new group for new group of experiments
xman.make_group('Another Group', 'Group for pipeline exps')

# Define params as a dict:
params = {'param1': 3, 'param2': 2}

# Make a new exp using params in its name:
xman.make_exp(2, f"Exp with {params['param1']} and {params['param2']}", 
              'My exp with pipeline')
# xman.exp(2, 1).status -> `EMPTY`

# Make the pipeline:
xman.exp(2, 1).make_pipeline(train_pipeline, params)
# xman.exp(2, 1).status -> `TO_DO`

# Start the exp with pipeline:
xman.exp(2, 1).start()
# xman.exp(2, 1).status -> `IN_PROGRESS`

# ...the execution took some time...

# xman.exp(2, 1).status -> `DONE`
xman.exp(2, 1).info()
# Output:
#     Exp 1 [DONE] Exp with 3 and 2 - My exp with pipeline    
#         Resolution: -= auto status =-    
#         Result:
#             Score 1: 6, Score 2: 4

# Finalise the exp:
xman.exp(2, 1).success("You're awesome!")
# xman.exp(2, 1).status -> `SUCCESS`
```

</details>

#### Pipelines with checkpoints
<details><summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

```python
# Define a pipeline with checkpoints (add `mediator` as the first param):
from xman.pipeline import CheckpointsMediator 

def train_pipeline_with_mediator(mediator: CheckpointsMediator, param1, param2):
    # init model and environment

    # if it's not the first run of this exp, and the exp wasn't completed, and
    # there was some saved checkpoint, you can init your train from the saved
    # in the checkpoint state:
    cp_paths = mediator.get_checkpoint_paths_list()
    if cp_paths is not None:
        cp = mediator.load_checkpoint(cp_paths[-1])
        # init using information from this loaded checkpoint

    # start train model

    # save checkpoint (e.g. after each N epochs), you can save anything 
    # you need for starting from this position:
    cp = '...my checkpoint...'
    mediator.save_checkpoint(cp, replace=True)

    # finish train model
    # validate and calculate score
    return f"Score 1: {param1 * 2}, Score 2: {param2 ** 2}"

# Define params as a dict:
params = {'param1': 4, 'param2': 3}

# Make a new exp using params in its name:
xman.make_exp(2, f"Exp with {params['param1']} and {params['param2']}", 
              'My exp with pipeline')
# xman.exp(2, 2).status -> `EMPTY`

# Make the pipeline:
xman.exp(2, 2).make_pipeline_with_checkpoints(
    train_pipeline_with_mediator, params)
# xman.exp(2, 2).status -> `TO_DO`

# Start the exp with pipeline:
xman.exp(2, 2).start()
# xman.exp(2, 2).status -> `IN_PROGRESS`

# ...the execution took some time...

# xman.exp(2, 2).status -> `DONE`
xman.exp(2, 2).info()
# Output:
#     Exp 2 [DONE] Exp with 4 and 3 - My exp with pipeline    
#         Resolution: -= auto status =-    
#         Result:
#             Score 1: 8, Score 2: 9

# Finalise the exp:
xman.exp(2, 2).success("Smile)")
# xman.exp(2, 2).status -> `SUCCESS`
```

After saving a checkpoint you can reach it with the mediator:
```python
mediator = xman.exp(2, 2).checkpoints_mediator  # get mediator
cp_paths = mediator.get_checkpoint_paths_list()  # get paths
if cp_paths is not None:
    cp = mediator.load_checkpoint(cp_paths[-1])  # get the last checkpoint
    print(cp)
 # Output:
 #     ...my checkpoint...
```

You can delete checkpoints with `xman.exp(2, 2).delete_checkpoints()`.

## What's next
- Tests coverage
- API Documentation coverage
- `grid-search` implementing (there are some issues with storage space consumption)

TODO



## Conclusion

TODO: It's not a secret, that takes a lot of time and many attempts to find best parameters, so gives competitive advantage
